## About
I am a Computer Engineering and Economics (with a minor in Mathematics) student at Utah State University (USU). I plan to graduate in the Spring of 2023.
This GitHub account contains work I have done in my leisure time and work I completed for classes.

I love to learn all sorts of new things. As long as I'm learning,
I'm usually happy. The only times I am not is when something just doesn't make sense. To curve that issue, I like to collect as many resourses on topics I learn as
I possibly can. For that very reason, I collect many of the interesting links I find across the internet. I will hold some of those links below. Many of them will
be links to more links. It is an endless rabbit hole of resources. Enjoy!
