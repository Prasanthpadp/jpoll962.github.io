## About
I am a Computer Engineering and Economics (with a minor in Mathematics) student at Utah State University (USU). I plan to graduate in the Spring of 2023.
This GitHub account contains work I have done in my leisure time and work I completed for classes.

I love to learn all sorts of new things. As long as I'm learning,
I'm usually happy. The only times I am not is when something just doesn't make sense. To curve that issue, I like to collect as many resourses on topics I learn as
I possibly can. For that very reason, I collect many of the interesting links I find across the internet. I will hold some of those links below. Many of them will
be links to more links. It is an endless rabbit hole of resources.

If you know of any other amazing resources, don't hesitate to reach out to me at jpoll962@yahoo.com! Enjoy!
