# MATH4610 Directory

The following links are in regard to my MATH4610 repository. As of right now, this is a private repository, so non-collaborators will not
be able to view the links provided. This repository is the course work completed and in-progress for Fundamentals of Computational Mathematics
at Utah State University (USU) during the Fall Semester of 2020.

Throughout this course, I will be using the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) with the Windows Command Line Interface (CMD) to compile and
push files. I will use Visual Studio and Visual Studio Code as a text editor for my code.
