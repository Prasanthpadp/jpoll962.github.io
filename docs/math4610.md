# MATH4610 Directory

The following links are in regard to my MATH4610 repository. As of right now, this is a private repository, so non-collaborators will not
be able to view the links provided. This repository is the course work completed and in-progress for Fundamentals of Computational Mathematics
at Utah State University (USU) during the Fall Semester of 2020.

Throughout this course, I will be using the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) with the Windows Command Line Interface (CMD) to compile and
push files. I will use Visual Studio and Visual Studio Code as a text editor for my code.

## Links
* [Homework Table of Contents](https://github.com/jpoll962/math4610/blob/master/hw_toc/hw_toc.md)
  - This will contain my tasksheets completed for the MATH4610 class.
* [Lecture Work](https://github.com/jpoll962/math4610/blob/master/lecture_work/lecture_work.md)
  - This will contain work I have completed for the MATH4610 class that was not required in a tasksheet asignment.
* [Basic Git Commands](https://github.com/jpoll962/math4610/blob/master/How_To_Git.txt)
  - This is a text file to quickly remind me what basic git commands I need to work from a CLI with my github repository.
